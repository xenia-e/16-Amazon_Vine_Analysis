# 16-Amazon_Vine_Analysis
analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program

# Purpouse

The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the provided dataset.

## Methods 

Use **PySpark** to perform the **ETL process** to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an **AWS RDS instance**, and load the transformed data into **pgAdmin**. Next, youâ€™ll use **PySpark** to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. 

### Deliverables

__Deliverable 1:__ Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews ([Amazon_Reviews_ETL.ipynb](https://github.com/xenia-e/16-Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/Amazon_Reviews_ETL.ipynb))

__Deliverable 2:__ Determine Bias of Vine Reviews([Vine_Review_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/xenia-e/16-Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/Vine_Review_Analysis.ipynb))

__Deliverable 3:__ A Written Report on the Analysis [(README.md)](https://github.com/xenia-e/16-Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/README.md)

### Resourses
a dataset from the [Amazon Review datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt) (Musical_Instruments)



#Results

Using PySpark we performed analysis to determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. Performed calculations lead us to the following conclusions (see figure 1 and 2):

- Total number of Vine reviews: 60, while the total number of NON-Vine reviews: 14477

- There were 34 5-stars Vine reviews vs 8212 non-Vine reviews 5 stars.

- There were about 57% of 5-stars reviews from both Vine and non-Vine reviewers

#Summary

As analysis shows, the percentage of positive reviews is the same for Vine and non-Vine users. So it is safe to assume that there is no positivity bias for the reviews in the Vine program for the current dataset. 

Taking into account, that most users are more likely to leave a review after a negative experience, we can assume that Vine users' reviews are trustworthy in our case. 

Additionally, we could analyze the statistical distribution (mean, median, and mode) of the star rating for the Vine and non-Vine reviews. So as analyze texts of reviews for similarity, usage of similar word constructions and style, to eliminate fake reviews.
